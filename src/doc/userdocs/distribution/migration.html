          This document explains how to migrate your Fedora repository from 
          version 2.x to 3.0.  Before continuing, you should familiarize 
          yourself with the new  <a href="javascript:alert('TODO:add link here')">
          Content Model Architecture.</a>  A basic understanding of how the 
          CMA works will be helpful in understanding the migration process. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Throughout this guide, OLD_FEDORA_HOME refers to the home directory
          of your Fedora 2.2.x installation, and NEW_FEDORA_HOME refers to the
          home directory of your new Fedora 3.0 installation.

          Follow the instructions in the <a href="installation.html">
          Fedora Installation Guide.</a>.  When finished, start the server
          and verify your installation was successful by visiting the
          <em>describeRepository</em> page (e.g. 
          <a href="http://localhost:8080/fedora/describe">
          http://localhost:8080/fedora/describe</a>).  Finally, shut down
          Fedora.  It should not be restarted again until later in the
          migration process.

          The analyzer examines all of your existing digital objects and 
          looks for similarities.  It outputs the following information in 
          a directory you specify.
          <br/>

          <li> Configuring the Analyzer
            <span class="plaintext">
              The analyzer accepts a Java properties file for configuration.
              <br/>
 
NOTE: In properties files, the "\" character must be escaped.  When using Windows, this means paths like "c:\work\abc" must be written as "c:\\work\\abc".
 
Create a file (e.g. migration.properties) with the following content, filling in values appropriate to your environment:
 
# This is the directory where the analyzer's output files should be sent.
 # If it doesn't already exist, it will be automatically created.
 # If it already exists, it must be empty (to avoid accidental overwrites)
 # To disable the above restriction, uncomment clearOutputDir=true below.

 #clearOutputDir=true
 
# The Fedora 3.0 home directory.
 fedoraHome=c:\\fedora-3.0
 
# The full path to the JDBC driver Fedora is configured to use.
# NOTE: The analyzer only uses the database to aid in looking up
# the location of FOXML.  It will populate the initial paths in
# the database the first time it runs, if the necessary.

<li> Analyzer Usage
The analyzer utility is an executable jar and takes the configuration file as a parameter.  For example, if your configuration is in the current directory and is named migration.properties, enter the following:

java -jar analyzer.jar migration.properties

Analysis of small repositories will finish very quickly.  For repositories with millions of objects, analysis will take several hours.  With modern hardware, expect a rate of about 10,000 objects per minute.

Reviewing Analyzer Output

The analyzer will produce several files in the output directory.


Generated content models will be in FOXML 1.1 format and will be named cmodel-n.xml (where n is a number used for association).  For each of these, there will be an associated cmodel-n.members.txt file containing a list of PIDs that conform to the content model.


Each content model object will contain the following inline XML datastreams:


      * CLASS-DESCRIPTION
This is a simple human-readable log of the matching aspects of all member objects found during the analysis process.  This datastream is not used or recognized by Fedora; it is only included for documentation purposes and may be removed at any time.

      * DS-COMPOSITE-MODEL
This is a special Fedora-defined description of the datastreams (and aspects thereof) that member objects are expected to have.  You'll notice that it contains a subset of the information expressed in CLASS-DESCRIPTION.  This datastream is important, and should not be removed from the content model object.

If the member objects had disseminators:


         * You will notice that the generated content model also has a RELS-EXT datastream.  This RDF datastream points to the original Behavior Definition objects via a Fedora-defined hasBDef relationship.  This relationship means that members of this content model should have the behaviors defined within the target BDef(s).
         * There will also be an associated cmodel-n-bmechs.txt file in the output directory.  For each Behavior Mechanism formerly used by the objects' disseminators, this file identifies the original BMech, specifies a PID for a new, similar BMech, and specifies a set of datastream input name changes that the copy should have.  This information is used by the generator to create new content-model-specific Behavior Mechanism objects.

Three additional files will be created in the output directory:


         * bdefs.txt - this lists all original Behavior Definition objects.
The generator will create a stylesheet to upgrade these objects to FOXML 1.1.

         * bmechs.txt - this lists all original Behavior Mechanism objects.
Although these objects will be made obsolete by the new, generated Behavior Mechanisms, the generator will create a stylesheet to upgrade them to FOXML 1.1 so that you can view them in the Fedora 3.0 repository before deciding to purge them.

         * nocmodel.txt - this lists objects that should NOT be assigned a content model.
Initially, the file is empty but it can be customized, if desired (see Upgrading Objects Without Content Models below).

Customizing Content Model PIDs

By default, the PIDs assigned to the generated content models are of the form, changeme:CModelN.  You should at least change these to use your own repository's namespace.  You may also want to change the identifier part of the PID (e.g. myns:Journal).

To do this, open each cmodel-n.xml file in an editor and change the following as desired:

            * The value of the PID attribute at the root of the document.

            * If there is a RELS-EXT datastream, change the part after info:fedora/ in the rdf:about attribute.  For example, change rdf:about="info:fedora/changeme:CModel1" to rdf:about="info:fedora/myorg:Journal".

Customizing Behavior Mechanism PIDs
If any cmodel-n-bmechs.txt files were created by the analyzer, you should also change each NEW_BMECH pid specified within before continuing.  These PIDs will default to values like "changeme:CModel1-BMech1", but again, you should specify your own (e.g. myns:Journal-BMech1).  Note: DO NOT SPECIFY the same PID for NEW_BMECH as you had for OLD_BMECH, as this will cause ingest problems later.

Upgrading Objects Without Content Models

By default, the analyzer ensures that every data object is assigned to a content model.  If you'd rather avoid assigning a content model to an object, you may do so by a) removing its PID from the cmodel-n-members.txt file in which it resides and b) adding it to the nocmodel.txt file.  This may be done for any number of objects.

IMPORTANT: In order for migration to work properly, the PID of every object in the source repository must occur exactly once in the set of PID list files.

 
        </span>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h2 id="generator">Run the Generator</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
The generator reads the output of the analyzer and adds the following to the same directory:


               * New Behavior Mechanism objects (as specified in cmodel-n-members.txt)

               * Stylesheets for transforming existing objects as necessary


NOTE: the generator does not make changes to the source objects.

Configuring the Generator
Like the analyzer, the generator accepts a Java properties file for configuration.

The configuration file should have the following content, with values filled in appropriate to your environment.  NOTE: Since you already entered fedoraHome and jdbcJar in migration.properties, you can minimize typing by just using that file, and adding the necessary sourceDir parameter  as shown below.

# This is the directory containing the analyzer's output, and where the generator's
# results should be written.
sourceDir=c:\\fedora-migration

# The Fedora 3.0 home directory
fedoraHome=c:\\fedora-3.0

# The full path to the JDBC driver Fedora is configured to use
 jdbcJar=c:\\fedora-3.0\\tomcat\\webapps\\fedora\\WEB-INF\\lib\\postgresql-8.2-506.jdbc3.jar

Generator Usage

The generator utility also the configuration file as a parameter.  For example:

java -jar generator.jar migration.properties

The generator should finish within a few seconds, regardless of the size of the repository.

Reviewing Generator Output

The generator will produce several files in the output directory.  Again, these files will be used as input to later steps in the process.


One stylesheet will be written for each PID list: bmechs.xslt, bdefs.xslt, nocmodel.xslt, and cmodel-n.members.xslt.  Each of these stylesheets includes transformation rules for upgrading the objects to FOXML1.1 and adding the necessary hasContentModel relationship via RELS-EXT, if necessary.  NOTE: The generated stylesheet will cause a new RELS-EXT datastream to be created, or will amend the content of the latest revision of the RELS-EXT datastream, if it already exists.

The output will also include a new, generated Behavior Mechanism object (cmodel-n.bmechx.txt) for each one listed in the input's cmodel-n.bmechs.txt file.  This BMech will match the content of the source BMech in the repository, but it will have a different PID, will be in FOXML 1.1 format, and will use input part names consistent with the datastream IDs specified in the associated content model's DS-COMPOSITE-MODEL datastream.

        </span>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h2 id="transformer">Run the Transformer</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
The transformer applies stylesheets to FOXML stored in a Fedora repository.  Although it directly accepts the output of the generator utility, it can also be used outside of the migration process for making low-level changes to batches of objects.  When running the transformer in this way, the repository should be shut down, and the rebuilder should be run immediately afterward (see section below).

Here's how the transformer works:  It scans a directory for PID list files, ending with .txt.  For each, if a .xslt file exists with the same name, that stylesheet is applied to the repository's FOXML for each object in the PID list.

WARNING: the transformer makes changes to objects in the repository.  It it possible to damage some, or all of the objects in the repository by using the transformer, so be sure to make a backup first!

Configuring the Transformer
Like the analyzer and generator, the transformer accepts a Java properties file for configuration.  The transformer is configured with the same properties that the generator is configured with (see above), and also takes the following:

# Whether to run the transformer in "dry run" mode or not.
# In dry run mode, transformation will be tested but no changes will be written
dryRun=true

Although not required, it is strongly recommended that you run the transformer with dryRun=true the first time, to ensure all transformations will fully succeed.

Transformer Usage
The transformer utility also takes the configuration file as a parameter.  For example:

java -jar transformer.jar migration.properties

Transformation will take roughly double the time that analysis took, since it must read and write each file in the repository.
 
        </span>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h2 id="rebuilder">Run the Rebuilder</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
Now that all of your existing objects have been upgraded, you need to run the rebuilder so Fedora's database is up-to-date with the files on disk.  See the Rebuilder Documentation for further details.  NOTE: You should at least rebuild the SQL database.  If you plan to use the Resource Index, make sure your fedora.fcfg file has the "level" set to "1", and rebuild it also.

Running the rebuilder will be the most time-consuming step of the process.

        </span>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h2 id="ingest">Ingest Generated Objects</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
After the rebuilder has run successfully, you should restart your Fedora 3.0 instance and visit the describe page (e.g. http://localhost:8080/fedora/describe) to make sure it started successfully.

Now you'll need to ingest all the newly-created content model and Behavior Mechanism objects created by the analyzer+generator steps.  To do this:


                  1. Run fedora-admin.bat or fedora-admin.sh and login to your new repository from the local machine.

                  2. Go to File -» Ingest -» Objects from Directory, and navigate to the directory where these files were written (e.g. C:\fedora-migration)
                  3. Choose FOXML as the format, and OK.
        </span>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h2 id="verify">Verify Success and Clean Up</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
You should now verify that the upgraded objects are behaving as expected.  Pick a few from each content model and do the following for each:


                     1. Visit their "Object Profile" page (e.g. http://localhost:8080/fedora/get/demo:MyPID)
                     2. From that page, navigate to "View Item Index", and click each datastream, ensuring it downloads properly.
                     3. If you had dissseminators in your original repository, you should also navigate to the "View Dissemination Index" page and make sure your old disseminations appear, and that they execute properly.


If you had disseminators in your original repository, you are now making use of a NEW set of Behavior Mechanism objects.  You may also wish to purge the original ones.  The simplest way to do this is with the fedora-admin GUI:


                        1. Run fedora-admin.bat or fedora-admin.sh and login to your new repository from the local machine.
                        2. Go to Tools -» Search, go into the advanced tab and add a condition that "fType" "equals" "M".
                        3. Click OK and find your old Behavior Mechanism objects in the list.
                        4. Select all the old ones (ctrl-click to select multiple), right-click and select "Purge Objects".
